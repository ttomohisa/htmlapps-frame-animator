The project uses Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- Initial Frame Animator application built on the current Browser Kitty `htmlapps-template`.
- Local multi-image import for JPEG, PNG, and still WebP.
- File selection, Drag & Drop, and add-more workflow.
- Thumbnail cards with filename, dimensions, megapixels, and source byte size.
- Animated WebP detection and rejection for detectable RIFF/VP8X/ANIM files.
- Safety limits for frame count, individual file size, total source bytes, and decoded pixel count.
- Partial import failure reporting without discarding valid files from the same batch.
- Explicit confirmation before clearing all imported images.
- Japanese / English interface and help content.
- Responsive desktop and smartphone layouts.
- Local-only runtime policy with `connect-src 'none'` and no runtime third-party dependency.

### Notes

- v0.1.0 intentionally does not implement frame reordering, timing, animation preview, or GIF/WebP export yet. Those capabilities are staged in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.
